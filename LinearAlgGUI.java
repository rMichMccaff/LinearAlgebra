/*

The goal of the progam is to create an interface for the user to perform common
actions in Linear Algebra.  

First, we'll primarilly start with creating a menu to ask the user what are 
some of the things they want to do.  There will be two options the first will 
be over vector and matrix operations.  

They will then be asked for what operation to perform.  The user will then be
prompted to provide a vector input the two and then release a solution.
